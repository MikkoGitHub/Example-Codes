//C# basics by Mikko 

int a = 1
int b = 3

string c = "hello";

MessageBox.Show(a + b + " " + c);
//output -> 4 hello
//C# operates calculation if the integers are not in string or char form or there is no space or other formatting between (as in my knowledge).

//this shows one valid way to get each of the numbers without adding them together +""+ as in invisible space between or whatever string you like.
//MessageBox.Show(a +""+ b + " " + c);

//now for simple foreach loop the loop trough the string c "hello"
//foreach ((what and name) from (target) example, array or in this case string, string consist chars, so we can loop through them
//so foreach "hello" characters in the string, which are "h, e, l, l, o" we loop through
//this shows error however because of the miscast type, messagebox.show can only show strings NOT chars

foreach(char d in c)
{
   MessageBox.Show(d);
}

//to fix this we simple need to cast d into string, with .ToString() function 
//and it works!

foreach(char d in c)
{
   MessageBox.Show(d.ToString());
}
